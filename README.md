# ft_containers
The implementation of templated classes that behave exactly like the C++ 98 STL containers.

## ðŸ’» DONE

### This project aim was to implement C++98 containers:

- Vector
- Stack (Based on vector)
- Map (Based on Red-Black search tree)

#### Some utilities:

- iterators_traits
- reverse_iterator
- is_integral
- equal
- lexicographical_compare
- ft::pair
- ft::make_pair

Namespace to use is ft. Vector, map and set has iterator system. 
It was used allocator for memory allocation

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/mlagranzh/ft_containers
  ```

## ðŸš€ Run
  ```shell
  c++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++98 && ./a.out
  ```
